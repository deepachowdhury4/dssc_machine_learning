# Predicting Power Performance Of Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells Using Machine Learning Techniques
Howdy!

My project (Team 83) is Predicting Power Performance Of Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells Using Machine Learning Techniques. I will be doing this project individually in ECEN 403H, Sec. 971. 

Solar cells have great potential as energy conversion devices, but their use is limited due to intermittent sunlight. Integrating solar cells electrical energy storage devices can be a solution to this problem. In the last decade, the development of green carbon materials or biomaterials has attracted special attention. The main advantages of those biomass materials are their abundance, low cost, and waste mitigation. They exhibit excellent conductivity and rich porosity making them potential candidates for electrochemical energy storage and solar cells. However, due to a lack of time and materials, it’s very difficult to test all the variations of biomaterials utilized in solar cell and energy storage systems. This research builds on top of previous research that hasn’t yet utilized machine learning to predict efficiencies for Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) and aims to utilize machine learning to provide a low-cost solution for high-performance bio-based materials for solar energy conversion and storage. Specifically, the machine learning (ML) models will predict the performance of the system for various parameters, including Power Conversion Efficiency, photon-to-current conversion efficiency, and photocatalytic degradation.
